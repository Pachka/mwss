#' Generate global parameters dataset
#'
#' @description It calculates 1) the prevalence from daily incidence in the community and average disease duration,
#' 2) the probability of transmission per day spent in contact based on R0 and average disease duration,
#' 3) the time ratios of the epidemiological state based on average states duration,
#' 4) the proportion of time outside of work, and
#' 5) the proportion of probabilities of developing mild and severe symptoms for patients.
#'
#' Then the functions formats all global parameters required for the transitions as a named list readable by SimInf package.
