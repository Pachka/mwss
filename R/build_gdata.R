#' @description It calculates 1) the prevalence from daily incidence in the community and average disease duration,
#' 2) the probability of transmission per day spent in contact based on R0 and average disease duration,
#' 3) the time ratios of the epidemiological state based on average states duration,
#' 4) the proportion of time outside of work, and
